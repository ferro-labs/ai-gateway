# Ferro Labs AI Gateway — Public Roadmap

> Ferro Labs AI Gateway is an open-source AI Gateway that routes requests across LLM
> providers with a single OpenAI-compatible API. This roadmap outlines the
> planned evolution from the initial v0.1.0 release through production-grade v1.0.

| **BaseProvider extraction** | Extract shared provider boilerplate (`Name`, `Models`, HTTP client) into an embeddable struct to reduce ~400 LOC duplication | ✅ Done |
| **File-backed key storage** | JSON or SQLite file persistence for API keys (survives restarts without external database) | ⏭️ Deferred to v0.4.0 |
| **EventPublisher refactor** | Replace the baked-in `EventPublisher` interface with a plugin/hook pattern to keep the core clean for OSS | ✅ Done |

## v0.4.5 — Model Catalog & Accurate Pricing

**Status**: ✅ Released  
**Theme**: Replace hardcoded pricing with a live 2500+ model catalog for accurate, per-request cost tracking.

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Model catalog** | `models` package: typed catalog with 2531 entries loaded from an embedded JSON file (with remote refresh fallback) | ✅ Done |
| **Full pricing coverage** | Per-model input, output, cache-read, cache-write, reasoning, image, audio, and embedding prices (USD/1M tokens) | ✅ Done |
| **Cost calculator** | `models.Calculate()` dispatches by model mode; returns itemised `CostResult` with 9 cost buckets | ✅ Done |
| **Provider token extensions** | OpenAI extracts `reasoning_tokens` + `cached_tokens`; Anthropic extracts `cache_creation` / `cache_read` tokens from API responses | ✅ Done |
| **Gateway wiring** | `Gateway.New()` loads catalog; `Route()` calls `models.Calculate()` replacing `EstimateCost()` (streaming cost tracking is a v0.5 item) | ✅ Done |
| **Event cost breakdown** | `publishEvent` emits 9 cost fields: `cost_usd`, `cost_input_usd`, `cost_output_usd`, `cost_cache_read_usd`, `cost_cache_write_usd`, `cost_reasoning_usd`, `cost_image_usd`, `cost_audio_usd`, `cost_embedding_usd` | ✅ Done |

## v0.5.0 — Advanced Routing & Intelligence

**Status**: ✅ Released
**Theme**: Smart routing based on cost, latency, and content.

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **CLI UX overhaul** | `ferrogw-cli` migrated to Cobra: richer admin command groups (`admin keys`, `admin config`, `admin logs`, `admin providers`), `--format table/json/yaml` output flag, shell completions via `ferrogw-cli completion` | ✅ Done |
| **Streaming cost tracking** | `RouteStream()` now wraps the SSE channel in a metering goroutine; emits Prometheus metrics (duration, tokens, cost) and event hooks on stream close, matching `Route()` behaviour | ✅ Done |
| **Retry policies** | `RetryConfig` extended with `on_status_codes` (only retry listed HTTP status codes) and `initial_backoff_ms` (configurable exponential backoff base); applied per-target in the fallback strategy | ✅ Done |
| **Least-latency routing** | New `least-latency` strategy mode; in-process rolling-window p50 tracker (`internal/latency`) records observed latency per provider; routes to fastest compatible provider, falls back to random when no samples exist | ✅ Done |
| **Cost-optimized routing** | New `cost-optimized` strategy mode; estimates prompt cost via the model catalog for each compatible provider and routes to the cheapest; falls back to first compatible provider when pricing is unavailable | ✅ Done |

---

## v0.5.5 — Intelligent Request Handling

**Status**: 📋 Planned
**Theme**: Route based on what the request says, not just what model it targets.

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Content-based routing** | Extend conditional strategy with `prompt_contains` and `prompt_regex` match keys; `X-Route-Tag` header overrides all rules via `header_routing` config map |
| **A/B testing** | New `ab-test` strategy mode; traffic split by percentage across named variants; `variant` label on all Prometheus metrics; `GET /admin/experiments` endpoint for live stats |

---

## v0.6.0 — Developer Experience

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Release Date**: 2026-03-06  
**Theme**: Server-side prompt management to eliminate client-side template sprawl.

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Prompt templates** | First-class `PromptTemplate` entity with CRUD admin API (`/admin/templates`); `template_id` + `variables` fields in request body; Go `text/template` rendering injected into `messages` before routing; memory / SQLite / PostgreSQL backends |

---

## v0.7.0 — Reliability & Regression Coverage

**Status**: ✅ Released
**Release Date**: 2026-03-08
**Theme**: Harden edge cases found in production, lock behaviour with regression tests.

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Fallback unsupported-model error** | When no target supports the requested model, return a clear error instead of a malformed `%!w(<nil>)` message | ✅ Done |
| **Event hook panic isolation** | Panics inside async event hooks are recovered and logged; no longer crash the gateway process | ✅ Done |
| **Legacy completions URL normalisation** | `/v1/completions` proxy target no longer produces duplicate `/v1` path segments | ✅ Done |
| **Legacy completions shim streaming** | Explicit `streaming_not_supported` error returned when `stream=true` on the non-proxy shim path | ✅ Done |
| **Config persistence rollback safety** | `config_store` reload is now rollback-safe on failures; runtime and stored config stay consistent | ✅ Done |
| **Admin config HTTP status mapping** | Persistence/internal reload failures return `500`; validation errors remain `400` | ✅ Done |
| **Regression test coverage** | `fallback_test.go`, `gateway_test.go`, `completions_test.go`, `config_store_test.go`, `handlers_test.go` explicitly test all of the above | ✅ Done |

## v0.8.0 — MCP Integration (Phase 1)

**Status**: ✅ Released
**Release Date**: 2026-03-09
**Theme**: First-class Model Context Protocol support — attach external tool servers and let the LLM drive an agentic loop without changing client code.

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **`internal/mcp` package** | Types, thread-safe client, concurrent-safe registry, and agentic executor wired into the gateway | ✅ Done |
| **Streamable HTTP transport** | MCP 2025-11-25 spec — `initialize` handshake, `tools/list` discovery, `tools/call` invocation | ✅ Done |
| **`mcp_servers` config field** | `gateway.Config.MCPServers []mcp.ServerConfig` — zero-overhead when empty; URL, headers, `allowed_tools`, `max_call_depth`, `timeout_seconds` per server | ✅ Done |
| **Agentic tool-call loop** | After the LLM responds with `tool_calls`, the gateway resolves them via MCP servers and re-routes up to `max_call_depth` (default 5) iterations before returning the final answer | ✅ Done |
| **Parallel server init** | `Registry.InitializeAll` runs `initialize` + `tools/list` for all configured servers concurrently at startup | ✅ Done |
| **`allowed_tools` filter** | Per-server allowlist restricts which tools are exposed to the LLM, limiting blast radius | ✅ Done |
| **Hot-reload support** | `ReloadConfig` re-initialises the MCP registry and executor when `mcp_servers` changes | ✅ Done |
| **Config examples** | `config.example.yaml` and `config.example.json` updated with `mcp_servers` examples | ✅ Done |
| **Unit tests** | 22 tests across `types_test.go`, `client_test.go`, `registry_test.go`, `executor_test.go`; clean with `-race` | ✅ Done |

### What ships

| Category | Features |
|---|---|
| **MCP client** | `mcp.Client` — per-server HTTP client with custom headers, timeout, session-ID propagation |
| **MCP registry** | `mcp.Registry` — thread-safe map of named servers; parallel `InitializeAll`; deduplicated `AllTools` with allowlist filtering |
| **MCP executor** | `mcp.Executor` — agentic loop controller; dispatches `tool_calls` from LLM responses to the correct server; converts results back into assistant messages |
| **Config** | `mcp_servers` array in `gateway.Config`; zero cost when empty |
| **Loop guard** | `max_call_depth` per server (default 5); `ShouldContinueLoop` prevents runaway recursion |
